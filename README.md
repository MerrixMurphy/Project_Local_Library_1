# Project_Local_Library_1
An electonic library interface that allows for many features found on current library sites including, checking who borrows what, which books go with which author, how many books are checked out, how many account there are, etc.

It was made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but I only worked on the JS functions for the project in order to render the appropriate data like how many books are checked out.

There are no future plans for this project as it was assignment for the Thinkful program.
